# Installation

I watched several YouTube videos to properly install the tools I needed. I started with Ansible by first installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), since from my understanding, Ansible requires a Linux OS to run. After that, I installed Docker. I chose Docker Desktop because it already comes as a complete package, including Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
