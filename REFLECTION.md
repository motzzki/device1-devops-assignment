# Reflection

- What was the hardest part of this assignment?

  To be honest, this assignment was very hard for me because it was a huge leap outside of my comfort zone. Most of the tools and concepts were new to me, so I had to spend extra time understanding the basics before I could even start applying them. However, despite the difficulty, I was able to learn at least the fundamentals of the tools needed.
  The hardest part for me was configuring and working with Ansible because it is such a vast and powerful tool. There are many modules, syntaxes, and configurations to understand, and even small mistakes in YAML formatting can cause errors.

- What would you do differently if you had more time?

  To be honest, I would spend more time studying and strengthening my understanding of the fundamentals before jumping into implementation. I would go deeper into Ansible’s documentation, practice writing more playbooks, and experiment with different modules to become more comfortable with the syntax. I would also try to better understand how Docker and Ansible integrate together instead of relying mostly on trial and error.

- What questions do you still have about Docker/Ansible?

  First, with Docker, I still have questions about best practices in real-world projects. For example, how should Docker images be optimized for production? What is the proper way to manage volumes and persistent data securely? I also want to understand more about networking between multiple containers and how Docker is used in larger-scale deployments.
  For Ansible, one question I still have is how professionals know or find the right setup command or syntax to use. Since Ansible has so many modules and options, it can feel overwhelming to know which one is the correct or best choice for a specific task. I’m curious about how experienced users quickly identify the right module, understand its parameters, and apply it correctly in a playbook

- How did you approach learning these new technologies?

  Before diving into the assignment, I spent some time watching YouTube videos to get a general idea of how the tools work and how they are used in practice. I also referred to the official documentation, even though it was a bit advanced, to understand the key concepts and commands. After that, I learned mostly by doing experimenting, trying different commands, and learning through trial and error

- If you were deploying this to 100 devices, what concerns would you have?

  I would be concerned about networking, at least for the tools I used, to ensure that all devices can communicate properly and securely. I would also worry about scalability making sure that Ansible playbooks and Docker configurations can run efficiently across many devices without errors
